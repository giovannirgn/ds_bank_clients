# data_science_project_bank_clients

The number of service providers are being increased very rapidly in every business. In these days, there is no shortage of options for customers in the banking sector when choosing where to allocate their money.As a result, customer churn and engagement has become one of the top issues for most of the banks. 

In this project I would like to understand what are the main information available about a customer that help to predict whether or not she/he will continue to use a service offered by the bank.

I will show the results in a streamlit app.
